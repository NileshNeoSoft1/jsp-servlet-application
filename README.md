🦸‍♂️ Marvel Studios Portal

A simple JSP and Servlet-based web application that serves as a Marvel Studios fan portal.
This project demonstrates user authentication (login/signup), session handling, and dynamic UI rendering across multiple tabs — all using JSP, Servlets, and JSON-based user storage.

🚀 Features

User Authentication System

Login and Signup functionality implemented using Servlets.

User credentials stored and validated from an external JSON file.

Input validation for username and password.

Session-based user management (login persistence until logout).

Marvel Portal UI

Three main tabs (e.g. Home, Product, Contact).

Dashboard image and dynamic content loading on tab selection.

Responsive layout using Bootstrap and CSS.

Data Handling

JSON file used as a lightweight database to manage user data.

New users are appended to the JSON file on signup.
